# FPT_intern
This repository contains the projects I worked on during my internship at FPT, including:
- Pre-processing data by using correlation matrices to remove less related variables
- Predicting house price by linear regression.
- Labelling pictures, extracting features using HOG and training labelled pictures by Kneighbor Classifier.
